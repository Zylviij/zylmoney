* Heirarhical Budget categories
* Monthly Timestep for Budgeting / Variable Timestep for Analysis (low priority)
* repeats: daily, weekly (multi), monthly (first monday vs THE 6th), annually (multi?)
* short charges are reported as sum within the month (allowing for vastly asymetrical months)
* large charges are divided by percentage (you are to whatever percentage (by time) of what is left to be paid)
